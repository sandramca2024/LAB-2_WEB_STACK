            <h2>A Different Approach</h2>
            <p>Reconnect to your partner, your family, and yourself.</p>
            <p>Life is messy. Your might feel challenged in ways you can’t quite find your way out of. Relationships can easily become strained, and I find that your closest relationships impact how you feel day to day. Most people identify their greatest moments of joy, and their deepest moments of pain, as coming from and relating to the people closest to them. When things go off track you feel isolated, misunderstood, and hopeless. Many of my clients start therapy feeling incredibly lonely and misunderstood, often questioning whether their relationship can survive. But, through our work together, they find simple ways to reconnect to what matters most. Even though it feels like things unraveling, it’s possible to feel happy again.</p>
